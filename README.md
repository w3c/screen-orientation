This repo holds some of the sources for the [Screen Orientation API](https://w3c.github.io/screen-orientation/), an interface for Web applications to be able to:

  * Read the screen-orientation state of a device (portrait or landscape).
  * Be informed when the screen-orientation state changes.
  * Lock the screen orientation to a specific state.

The latest editorâ€™s draft is at https://w3c.github.io/screen-orientation/
