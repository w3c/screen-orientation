This repo holds some of the sources for the [Screen Orientation API](https://w3c.github.io/screen-orientation/), an interface for Web applications to be able to:

  * read the screen-orientation state of a device (portrait or landscape)

  * be informed when the screen-orientation state changes

  * lock the screen orientation to a specific state

The latest editor’s draft is at https://w3c.github.io/screen-orientation/
