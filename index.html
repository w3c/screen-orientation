        The <cite>Screen Orientation</cite> specification standardizes the
        types and angles for a device's screen orientation, and provides a
        means for locking and unlocking it. The API, defined by this
        specification, exposes the current type and angle of the device's
        screen orientation, and dispatches events when it changes. This enables
        web applications to programmatically adapt the user experience for
        multiple screen orientations, working alongside CSS. The API also
        allows for the screen orientation to be locked under certain
        preconditions. This is particularly useful for applications such as
        computer games, where users physically rotate the device, but the
        screen orientation itself should not change.

        To <dfn data-local-lt="locking the screen orientation|locked">lock the
        screen orientation</dfn> to an {{OrientationLockType}} |orientation|
        means that the screen can only be rotated by the user to a specific
        [=screen orientation=] - possibly at the exclusion of other
        orientations. The possible orientations to which the screen can be
        rotated is determined by the user agent, a user preference, the
        operating system's conventions, or the screen itself. For example,
        locking the orientation to [=landscape=] means that the screen can be
        rotated by the user to [=landscape-primary=] and maybe
        [=landscape-secondary=] if the system allows it, but won't change the
        orientation to [=portrait-secondary=] orientation.

        The [[[appmanifest]]] specification allows web applications to set the

        member.

        Accessibility considerations
      </h2>
      <p>
        As users can have their devices mounted in a fixed orientation (e.g. on
        the arm of a wheelchair), developers that expect users to rotate their
        device when [=locking the screen orientation=] need to be aware of the
        [[[WCAG21]]]'s <a data-cite="WCAG21#orientation">Orientation Success
        Criterion</a>. The criterion makes it <a data-cite=
        "WCAG21#dfn-essential">essential</a> that content and functionality is
        available regardless of the [=screen orientation=]. When a particular
        orientation is <a data-cite="WCAG21#dfn-essential">essential</a>, web
        applications must advise the user of the orientation requirements.

        Privacy and Security Considerations
      </h2>
      <p>
        A screen's [=Screen/current orientation type|type=] and
        [=Screen/current orientation angle|angle=] are a potential
        fingerprinting vector. The following mitigation help protect a user's
        privacy by not revealing how a device is being held, and also prevents
        the [=secondary=] orientation type and associated angles from being
        user for fingerprinting purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
        To resist fingerprinting (e.g., in private browsing), user agents MAY:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>For the life of a [=top-level browsing context=], behave as as if
        screen's [=natural=] orientation is
        {{ScreenOrientation/[[initialType]]}}.
        </li>
        <li>Restrict the possible return values of the
        {{ScreenOrientation/type}} getter to
        {{OrientationType/"portrait-primary"}} or
        {{OrientationType/"landscape-primary"}}. The screen aspect ratio
        determines which is returned.
        </li>
        <li>If the [=Screen/current orientation type=] matches
        {{ScreenOrientation/[[initialType]]}}, return `0` for the
        {{ScreenOrientation/angle}} getter. Otherwise, return `90`.
        </li>
        <li>If the screen orientation changes, only fire the
          <a data-link-for="ScreenOrientation">change</a> event when the
          [=Screen/current orientation type=] changes from [=portrait=] to
          [=landscape=], or vice versa.
        </li>
      </ol>
