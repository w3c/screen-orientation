      <p>
        For web applications, the <cite>Screen Orientation API</cite> exposes
        the type and angle of a device's current screen orientation, and
        dispatches events if the device's screen orientation changes. This
        allows web applications to programmatically adapt the user experience
        for many possible screen orientations in concert with CSS. If supported
        and if certain preconditions are met, the API also provides the ability
        to lock the screen orientation. This is useful in applications such as
        computer games where users physically rotate the device but the screen
        orientation itself mustn't change.

          To <dfn data-local-lt="locking the screen orientation|locked">lock
          the screen orientation</dfn> to an |orientation| means that the
          screen can only be rotated by the user to a specific [=screen
          orientation=] (possibly at the exclusion of other orientations). For
          example, locking the orientation to [=landscape=] means that the
          screen can be rotated by the user to [=landscape-primary=] and maybe
          [=landscape-secondary=], but not to a [=portrait=] orientation.

        <p>
          The <dfn>current orientation type</dfn> is the [=screen orientation=]

        </p>
        <p>
          The <dfn>current orientation angle</dfn> is the angle, in degrees,

          orientation.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a [=browsing context=] is created, the <a>user agent</a> MUST

          consistent.

          Developers need to be aware that a {{Screen/orientation}} object from
          a {{Document}} with a "hidden" [=Document/visibility state=] will not
          receive an orientation change event. This is to prevent unnecessary
          changes to layout, etc. in the non-visible web application.

          The [[[WCAG21]]] includes a <a data-cite="WCAG21#orientation">Success
          Criterion related to screen orientation</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          ​The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that all
          <a data-cite="WCAG21#dfn-essential">essential</a> content and
          functionality is available regardless of the display orientation
          (portrait or landscape). Some websites and applications automatically
          set the screen to a particular display orientation and expect that
          users will respond by rotating their device to match.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, some users may have their devices mounted in a fixed
          orientation (e.g. on the arm of a wheelchair). Therefore, websites
          and applications need to support both orientations by making sure
          <a data-cite="WCAG21#dfn-essential">essential</a> content and
          functionality is available in each orientation. While the order of
          content and method of functionality may have differences the content
          and functionality must always be available. When a particular
          orientation is <a data-cite="WCAG21#dfn-essential">essential</a>, the
          user needs to be advised of the orientation requirements.

        Privacy and Security Considerations
      </h2>
      <p>
        A screen's [=current orientation type|type=] and [=current orientation
        angle|angle=] are a potential fingerprinting vector. The following
        mitigation help protect a user's privacy by not revealing how a device
        is being held, and also prevents the [=secondary=] orientation type and
        associated angles from being user for fingerprinting purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
        To resist fingerprinting (e.g., in private browsing), user agents MAY:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Depending on the screen's aspect ratio, only return either
        {{OrientationType/"portrait-primary"}} or
        {{OrientationType/"landscape-primary"}} for the value of the
        {{ScreenOrientation/type}} attribute.
        </li>
        <li>For any [=natural=] orientation ([=portrait=] or [=landscape=]),
        always return `0` for the value of the {{ScreenOrientation/angle}}
        attribute. And for any rotated/opposite orientation, always return `90`
        for the value of the {{ScreenOrientation/angle}} attribute.
        </li>
        <li>If the screen orientation changes, only fire the
          <a data-link-for="ScreenOrientation">change</a> event when the
          [=current orientation type=] changes from [=portrait=] to
          [=landscape=], or vice versa.
        </li>
      </ul>
