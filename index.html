        The <cite>Screen Orientation API</cite> provides the ability to read
        the screen orientation type and angle, to be informed when the screen
        orientation changes, and to lock the screen to a specific orientation.

        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        For web applications, the <cite>Screen Orientation API</cite> exposes
        the type and angle of a device's current screen orientation, and can
        provide notification if the device's orientation changes. This allows
        web applications to programmatically adapt the user experience for many
        possible screen orientations (in concert with CSS). The API also allows
        locking the screen to a particular orientation. This is useful in
        applications such as computer games where users physically rotate the
        device but the screen orientation itself mustn't change.
      </p>

        <h2>
          Goals
        </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Allow a web application to have control over screen orientation
          where needed and without being intrusive to end users.
          </li>
          <li>Support a better user experience by providing developers with
          information on screen orientation changes so web applications can
          update correspondingly.
          </li>

            Locking to a specific orientation and unlocking

          <p>
            In this example, clicking the "Lock" button makes a request to go
            into fullscreen and then lock the screen to the opposite
            orientation. Pressing the "Unlock" button unlocks the screen so it
            rotates if the user turns the device.
          </p>
          <p>
            The developer console logs the change in orientation type and
            angle.

        <p>
          <dfn>Portrait-primary</dfn> is an orientation where the screen width
          is less than or equal to the screen height. If the device's natural
          orientation is portrait, then it is in portrait-primary when held in
          that position. If the device's natural orientation is landscape, the
          <a>user agent</a> sets portrait-primary from the two options as shown

        <p>
          <dfn>Portrait-secondary</dfn> is an orientation where the screen
          width is less than or equal to the screen height. If the device's
          natural orientation is portrait, then it is in portrait-secondary
          when rotated 180Âº from its natural position. If the device's natural

        <p>
          <dfn>Portrait</dfn> is an orientation where the screen width is less
          than or equal to the screen height and depending on platform
          convention locking the screen to portrait can represent
          portrait-primary, portrait-secondary or both.
        </p>
        <p>
          <dfn>Landscape</dfn> is an orientation where the screen width is
          greater than the screen height and depending on platform convention
          locking the screen to landscape can represent landscape-primary,
          landscape-secondary or both.
        </p>
        <p>
          <dfn>Natural</dfn> is an orientation that refers to either
          portrait-primary or landscape-primary depending on the device's usual
          orientation. This orientation is usually provided by the underlying
          operating system.
        </p>
        <p>
          <dfn>Any</dfn> is an orientation that means the screen can be locked

          and landscape-secondary.

          The <dfn>default orientation</dfn> is the set of orientations to
          which the screen is locked when there is no current <a>orientation
          lock</a>. This orientation is determined by the device's operating
          system, or the user agent (e.g., <a href=
          "#interaction-with-web-application-manifest"></a>), or controlled by
          the end-user.

          Reading the screen orientation
        </h2>
        <p>
          All <a>documents</a> have a <dfn>current orientation type</dfn> and a
          <dfn>current orientation angle</dfn>. Both of them SHOULD be
          initialized when the <a>document</a> is created, otherwise they MUST
          be initialized the first time they are accessed and before their
          value is read. The <a>user agent</a> MUST <a>update the orientation
          information</a> of the <a>document</a> to initialize them.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a given <a>document</a>, the <a>current orientation type</a> and
          the <a>current orientation angle</a> are strongly linked in the sense
          that for any given type, there will be a specific angle associated.
        </p>
        <p>
          One primary orientation will always be determined by the
          <a>natural</a> orientation of the device and this will then determine
          the secondary value of its related orientation.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example a device held in its natural <a>portrait</a> orientation
          would have a current orientation of <a>portrait-primary</a> and its
          <a>portrait-secondary</a> orientation would be its position when
          rotated 180Â°.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <a>user agent</a> can associate the other `*-primary` and
          `*-secondary` values at will. For example, it can be based on the
          device preferred angles, the user's preferred orientations or the
          current orientation when the application starts.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <a>screen orientation values table</a> presents the possible
          orientation types: <a>portrait-primary</a>,
          <a>portrait-secondary</a>, <a>landscape-primary</a> and
          <a>landscape-secondary</a>. The table shows the primary and secondary
          values that are determined by the device's <a>natural</a> orientation
          and the possibilities available to the <a>user agent</a> for setting
          the other primary and secondary orientation values.

          However, some users may have their devices mounted in a fixed

          The screen orientation type and angle of the device can be accessed
          with the API specified in this document, and can be a potential
          fingerprinting vector.
        </p>
        <p>
          The screen orientation type can already be known by using the screen
          width and height. In practice, the additional information provided
          with the API concerning the angle of the device and the primary or
          secondary screen orientation is unlikely to be used by any competent
          attack.
